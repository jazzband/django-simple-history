Common Issues
=============

Bulk Creating and Queryset Updating
-----------------------------------
``django-simple-history`` functions by saving history using a ``post_save`` signal
every time that an object with history is saved. However, for certain bulk
operations, such as bulk_create_, bulk_update_, and `queryset updates`_,
signals are not sent, and the history is not saved automatically. However,
``django-simple-history`` provides utility functions to work around this.

Bulk Creating a Model with History
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As of ``django-simple-history`` 2.2.0, we can use the utility function
``bulk_create_with_history`` in order to bulk create objects while saving their
history:

.. _bulk_create: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/models/querysets/#bulk-create
.. _bulk_update: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/models/querysets/#bulk-update


.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> from simple_history.utils import bulk_create_with_history
    >>> from simple_history.tests.models import Poll
    >>> from django.utils.timezone import now
    >>>
    >>> data = [Poll(id=x, question='Question ' + str(x), pub_date=now()) for x in range(1000)]
    >>> objs = bulk_create_with_history(data, Poll, batch_size=500)
    >>> Poll.objects.count()
    1000
    >>> Poll.history.count()
    1000

If you want to specify a change reason or history user for each record in the bulk create,
you can add `_change_reason`, `_history_user` or `_history_date` on each instance:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> for poll in data:
            poll._change_reason = 'reason'
            poll._history_user = my_user
            poll._history_date = some_date
    >>> objs = bulk_create_with_history(data, Poll, batch_size=500)
    >>> Poll.history.get(id=data[0].id).history_change_reason
    'reason'

You can also specify a default user or default change reason responsible for the change
(`_change_reason`, `_history_user` and `_history_date` take precedence).

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> user = User.objects.create_user("tester", "tester@example.com")
    >>> objs = bulk_create_with_history(data, Poll, batch_size=500, default_user=user)
    >>> Poll.history.get(id=data[0].id).history_user == user
    True

If you're using `additional fields in historical models`_ and have custom fields to
batch-create into the history, pass the optional dict argument ``custom_historical_attrs``
containing the field names and values.
A field ``session`` would be passed as ``custom_historical_attrs={'session': 'training'}``.

.. _additional fields in historical models: historical_model.html#adding-additional-fields-to-historical-models

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> from simple_history.tests.models import PollWithHistoricalSessionAttr
    >>> data = [
        PollWithHistoricalSessionAttr(id=x, question=f'Question {x}')
        for x in range(10)
    ]
    >>> objs = bulk_create_with_history(
            data, PollWithHistoricalSessionAttr,
            custom_historical_attrs={'session': 'training'}
        )
    >>> data[0].history.get().session
    'training'

Bulk Updating a Model with History (New)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bulk update was introduced with Django 2.2. We can use the utility function
``bulk_update_with_history`` in order to bulk update objects using Django's
``bulk_update`` function while saving the object history:


.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> from simple_history.utils import bulk_update_with_history
    >>> from simple_history.tests.models import Poll
    >>> from django.utils.timezone import now
    >>>
    >>> data = [Poll(id=x, question='Question ' + str(x), pub_date=now()) for x in range(1000)]
    >>> objs = bulk_create_with_history(data, Poll, batch_size=500)
    >>> for obj in objs: obj.question = 'Duplicate Questions'
    >>> bulk_update_with_history(objs, Poll, ['question'], batch_size=500)
    >>> Poll.objects.first().question
    'Duplicate Question``

If your models require the use of an alternative model manager (usually because the
default manager returns a filtered set), you can specify which manager to use with the
``manager`` argument:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> from simple_history.utils import bulk_update_with_history
    >>> from simple_history.tests.models import PollWithAlternativeManager
    >>>
    >>> data = [PollWithAlternativeManager(id=x, question='Question ' + str(x), pub_date=now()) for x in range(1000)]
    >>> objs = bulk_create_with_history(data, PollWithAlternativeManager, batch_size=500, manager=PollWithAlternativeManager.all_polls)

If you're using `additional fields in historical models`_ and have custom fields to
batch-update into the history, pass the optional dict argument ``custom_historical_attrs``
containing the field names and values.
A field ``session`` would be passed as ``custom_historical_attrs={'session': 'jam'}``.

.. _additional fields in historical models: historical_model.html#adding-additional-fields-to-historical-models

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> bulk_update_with_history(
            data, PollWithHistoricalSessionAttr, [],
            custom_historical_attrs={'session': 'jam'}
        )
    >>> data[0].history.latest().session
    'jam'

QuerySet Updates with History (Updated in Django 2.2)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Unlike with ``bulk_create``, `queryset updates`_ perform an SQL update query on
the queryset, and never return the actual updated objects (which would be
necessary for the inserts into the historical table). Thus, we tell you that
queryset updates will not save history (since no ``post_save`` signal is sent).
As the Django documentation says::

    If you want to update a bunch of records for a model that has a custom
    ``save()`` method, loop over them and call ``save()``, like this:

.. code-block:: python

    for e in Entry.objects.filter(pub_date__year=2010):
        e.comments_on = False
        e.save()

.. _queryset updates: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/models/querysets/#update

Note: Django 2.2 now allows ``bulk_update``. No ``pre_save`` or ``post_save`` signals are sent still.

Tracking Custom Users
---------------------

-   ``fields.E300``::

        ERRORS:
        custom_user.HistoricalCustomUser.history_user: (fields.E300) Field defines a relation with model 'custom_user.CustomUser', which is either not installed, or is abstract.

    Use ``register()`` to track changes to the custom user model
    instead of setting ``HistoricalRecords`` on the model directly.

    The reason for this, is that unfortunately ``HistoricalRecords``
    cannot be set directly on a swapped user model because of the user
    foreign key to track the user making changes.

Using F() expressions
---------------------
``F()`` expressions, as described here_, do not work on models that have
history. Simple history inserts a new record in the historical table for any
model being updated. However, ``F()`` expressions are only functional on updates.
Thus, when an ``F()`` expression is used on a model with a history table, the
historical model tries to insert using the ``F()`` expression, and raises a
``ValueError``.

.. _here: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/models/expressions/#f-expressions


Reserved Field Names
--------------------

For each base model that has its history tracked using ``django-simple-history``,
an associated historical model is created. Thus, if we have:

.. code-block:: python

    class BaseModel(models.Model):
        history = HistoricalRecords()

a Django model called ``HistoricalBaseModel`` is also created with all of the fields
from ``BaseModel``, plus a few extra fields and methods that are on all historical models.

Since these fields and methods are on all historical models, any field or method names
on a base model that clash with those names will not be on the historical model (and,
thus, won't be tracked). The reserved historical field and method names are below:

- ``history_id``
- ``history_date``
- ``history_change_reason``
- ``history_type``
- ``history_object``
- ``history_user``
- ``history_user_id``
- ``instance``
- ``instance_type``
- ``next_record``
- ``prev_record``
- ``revert_url``
- ``__str__``

So if we have:

.. code-block:: python

    class BaseModel(models.Model):
        instance = models.CharField(max_length=255)
        history = HistoricalRecords()

the ``instance`` field will not actually be tracked on the history table because it's
in the reserved set of terms.

Multi-table Inheritance
-----------------------

``django-simple-history`` supports tracking history on models that use multi-table
inheritance, such as:

.. code-block:: python

    class ParentModel(models.Model):
        parent_field = models.CharField(max_length=255)
        history = HistoricalRecords()

    class ChildModel(ParentModel):
        child_field = models.CharField(max_length=255)
        history = HistoricalRecords()


A few notes:

- On the child model, the ``HistoricalRecords`` instance is not inherited from the parent
  model. This means that you can choose to track changes on just the parent model, just
  the child model, or both.
- The child's history table contains all fields from the child model as well as all the
  fields from the parent model.
- Updating a child instance only updates the child's history table, not the parent's
  history table.


Usage with django-modeltranslation
----------------------------------

If you have ``django-modeltranslation`` installed, you will need to use the ``register()``
method to model translation, as described `here <https://github.com/django-commons/django-simple-history/issues/209#issuecomment-181676111>`__.


Pointing to the model
---------------------

Sometimes you have to point to the model of the historical records. Examples are Django's generic views or Django REST framework's serializers. You can get there through your HistoricalRecords manager you defined in your model. According to our example:

.. code-block:: python

    class PollHistoryListView(ListView): # or PollHistorySerializer(ModelSerializer):
        class Meta:
            model = Poll.history.model
           # ...

Working with BitBucket Pipelines
--------------------------------

When using BitBucket Pipelines to test your Django project with the
django-simple-history middleware, you will run into an error relating to missing migrations relating to the historic User model from the auth app. This is because the migration file is not held within either your project or django-simple-history.  In order to bypass the error you need to add a ```python manage.py makemigrations auth``` step into your YML file prior to running the tests.


Using custom OneToOneFields
---------------------------

If you are using a custom OneToOneField that has additional arguments and receiving
the following ``TypeError``::

    TypeError: __init__() got an unexpected keyword argument

This is because Django Simple History coerces ``OneToOneField`` into ``ForeignKey``
on the historical model. You can work around this by excluded those additional
arguments using ``excluded_field_kwargs`` as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    class Poll(models.Model):
        organizer = CustomOneToOneField(Organizer, ..., custom_argument="some_value")
        history = HistoricalRecords(
            excluded_field_kwargs={"organizer": set(["custom_argument"])}
        )
