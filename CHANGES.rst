Changes
=======

Unreleased
----------

  updating an object (gh-1262)
- Improved performance of the ``latest_of_each()`` history manager method (gh-1360)
- Fixed issue with deferred fields causing DoesNotExist error (gh-678)
- Added HistoricOneToOneField (gh-1394)
- Updated all djangoproject.com links to reference the stable version (gh-1420)
- Dropped support for Python 3.8, which reached end-of-life on 2024-10-07 (gh-1421)
- Added support for Django 5.1 (gh-1388)
- Added pagination to ``SimpleHistoryAdmin`` (gh-1277)
- Fixed issue with history button not working when viewing historical entries in the
  admin (gh-527)
- Move repository to the Django Commons organization (gh-1391)

3.7.0 (2024-05-29)
------------------

- Dropped support for Django 3.2, which reached end-of-life on 2024-04-01 (gh-1344)
- Removed the temporary requirement on ``asgiref>=3.6`` added in 3.5.0,
  now that the minimum required Django version is 4.2 (gh-1344)
- Migrated package building from using the deprecated ``setup.py`` to using
  ``pyproject.toml`` (with Hatchling as build backend);
  ``setup.py`` has consequently been removed (gh-1348)
- Added ``django>=4.2`` as an installation dependency, to mirror the minimum version
  tested in our CI (gh-1349)

3.6.0 (2024-05-26)
------------------

- Support custom History ``Manager`` and ``QuerySet`` classes (gh-1280)
- Renamed the (previously internal) admin template
  ``simple_history/_object_history_list.html`` to
  ``simple_history/object_history_list.html``, and added the field
  ``SimpleHistoryAdmin.object_history_list_template`` for overriding it (gh-1128)
- Deprecated the undocumented template tag ``simple_history_admin_list.display_list()``;
  it will be removed in version 3.8 (gh-1128)
- Added ``SimpleHistoryAdmin.get_history_queryset()`` for overriding which ``QuerySet``
  is used to list the historical records (gh-1128)
- Added ``SimpleHistoryAdmin.get_history_list_display()`` which returns
  ``history_list_display`` by default, and made the latter into an actual field (gh-1128)
- ``ModelDelta`` and ``ModelChange`` (in ``simple_history.models``) are now immutable
  dataclasses; their signatures remain unchanged (gh-1128)
- ``ModelDelta``'s ``changes`` and ``changed_fields`` are now sorted alphabetically by
  field name. Also, if ``ModelChange`` is for an M2M field, its ``old`` and ``new``
  lists are sorted by the related object. This should help prevent flaky tests. (gh-1128)
- ``diff_against()`` has a new keyword argument, ``foreign_keys_are_objs``;
  see usage in the docs under "History Diffing" (gh-1128)
- Added a "Changes" column to ``SimpleHistoryAdmin``'s object history table, listing
  the changes between each historical record of the object; see the docs under
  "Customizing the History Admin Templates" for overriding its template context (gh-1128)
- Fixed the setting ``SIMPLE_HISTORY_ENABLED = False`` not preventing M2M historical
  records from being created (gh-1328)
- For history-tracked M2M fields, adding M2M objects (using ``add()`` or ``set()``)
  used to cause a number of database queries that scaled linearly with the number of
  objects; this has been fixed to now be a constant number of queries (gh-1333)

3.5.0 (2024-02-19)
------------------

- Fixed ``FieldError`` when creating historical records for many-to-many fields with
  ``to="self"`` (gh-1218)

- Fixed ``HistoryRequestMiddleware`` deleting non-existent
  ``HistoricalRecords.context.request`` in very specific circumstances (gh-1256)
- Added ``custom_historical_attrs`` to ``bulk_create_with_history()`` and
  ``bulk_update_with_history()`` for setting additional fields on custom history models
  (gh-1248)
- Passing an empty list as the ``fields`` argument to ``bulk_update_with_history()`` is
  now allowed; history records will still be created (gh-1248)
- Added temporary requirement on ``asgiref>=3.6`` while the minimum required Django
  version is lower than 4.2 (gh-1261)
- Small performance optimization of the ``clean-duplicate_history`` command (gh-1015)
- Support Simplified Chinese translation (gh-1281)

- Fixed ``HistoryRequestMiddleware`` not cleaning up after itself (i.e. deleting
  ``HistoricalRecords.context.request``) under some circumstances (gh-1188)
- Made ``HistoryRequestMiddleware`` async-capable (gh-1209)
- Fixed error when setting ``table_name`` with ``inherit=True`` (gh-1195)
